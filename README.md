## Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, we work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. 

After transforming the data, we create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
