# Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, I and Judi work with as partners to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. 

After transforming the data, we create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
